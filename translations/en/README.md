# Front End Career

> A career guide to Front End Developers

##  What every Software Developer needs to know

You need to know: **nothing on this life is easy**, but if do you keep your humility and open mind, the path is far less thorny.

You will not become the most incredible developer of the universe just reading this guide, but can go far if you follow the advice of good and experienced people (which may or may not have contributed here).

No one is better than you. People just have more experience, more so because the *"be good"* depends on the point of view.

You can't build the most amazing code, performatic and scalable from day to night, but you can do it if you don't give up.

Your life/health worth more than your profession. Try to take care, rest, relax. Try to live outside your job.

We found somethings that the beginners need to know [this link](http://willianjusten.com.br/o-que-ninguem-diz-para-iniciantes/).

And we found somethings that unmotivated people must know  [this another link](http://woliveiras.com.br/posts/Por-que-voce-desistiu-de-ser-Cientista/)

Don't stay in your [confort zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS8V9eODGQ0)!

Although is good that you know, from beginning:

* [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
* Your code will be criticized and there is no problem with that. Learn from criticism.
* You need to enjoy on what you do, and one way to find out if it happens is analyzing if you like of what people that works with Front End, talks and do.
* The promotion from Jr to Entry Level is more technical, the experience and the study must lead to a buildup and greater control of more and more technology, tools, procedures.
* The promotion from Entry Level to Senior it is more posture, where the Programmer shall be regarded in fact as a professional, someone we know that we can spend a responsibility and rely on the result.

## Choose your side

It is always difficult to guide Front End developers on which technologies should study, becouse the job market is completely crazy! 

A possible separation for the responsibilities of the different Front End's types are: **Front End Engineer** and **Front End UI Developer**, as discussed in this [topic](https://github.com/frontendbr/forum/issues/32) from forum [Front End BR](https://github.com/frontendbr/) and this [issue](https://github.com/woliveiras/front-end-career/issues/5) here on Carreira Front End.

But before choosing which way to follow (Programming or Design), you need to understand that you are a **Developer**!

So first learn what you need for the different professional levels to become a good Developer.

* [Developer](./sources/developer.md)

  </a>
</p>

Then focus on a path:

* [Front End Engineer](./sources/engineer.md)
* [Front End UI Developer](./sources/ui-developer.md)

[On this link](http://www.frontendhandbook.com/practice/types-of-front-end-dev.html) we have more Front End profiles, so you can see where you're getting into! - It's crazy.
