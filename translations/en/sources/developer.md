# Developer career levels

## "Junior"
> The young Padawan

You have the right to make mistakes and the duty to stay thirsty for knowledge!

In that level you don't master programming languages, tools, development enviroment, perhaps neither the operating system that you will work. Easy... Focus on learn, take the advices of those who are longer on the area and look for absorb this knowledge.

You will make mistakes, lots of mistakes if you be proactive, but that's not bad. Unless you mistake the same thing every day. You can make these mistakes because you are trying... You are learning.

If you are not making mistakes is because you are trying litle. And, maybe, you are filling someone with questions, before even start to think. Careful with that attitude.

You need, not only in that level, put aside the shame (or the proud) and **ask**. No one will send you away for wanting to learn.

In this level you still doesn't master the art of delivering things quickly or estimate deadlines for the tasks.

Would be interesting you have a [mentor](https://github.com/training-center/mentoria/) or something like that. Can be a person who inspires you, to follow his steps and try make the same or someone with patience that helps you day to day.

When you earn enough XP, you will become **Mid level**!

## "Mid level"

> In a moment you become a master and will start to teach someone! =O

In this level you already can work very well by your own.

You have experience of 1/2 years or more as Junior (even less depending of your disposition and facility in learn) and already performs yours activities withou any help. Now you can also help others junior devs.

You are almost a master, so you are able to estimate deadlines for yours activities and deliver more faster things that you spent more time to do. Congratulations!

You should be capable to give your opinion to improve something that you work, can innovate bringing cool stuff to the work and continues thirsty for knowledge, don't putting others opinios.

Maybe your can't plan something big or build something from scratch by your own, but don't be sad about it. Look for improvement and [continue to swim](http://cinemacomrapadura.com.br/colunas/acme/288817/entenda-por-que-o-continue-a-nadar-e-o-hakuna-matata-dos-anos-2000/).

In this level, if you doesn't give up of learning and practicing, you may be confused with a **Senior** (or **Master**) and that's awesome! It's sign that you are learning a lot with time and is getting realy good.

Just don't let this go to your head!

The **Senior** level is the one that will demands more work and responsability and can be reached when you have between 4 and 6 years od experience. But don't focus in the time, focus on technical knowledge and others skills that you must have.

## "Senior"

> Congratulions, you won many fights, earned many titles and now can be considered a Master

In this level you have much experice with the programming languages that you usem, with the work tools, development enviroment, Operating System, etc.

Now you are capable of create something from scratch and scale it, by your own!

You have a good sense of deadlines and can specify that very well. You are also capable of coordinate a project, organize a team, delegate taks, evaluate the tasks completed by other members and answer precisely the client, manager or something like that.

You, now, are able to train other professionals. You can direct and help them to accomplish their goals.

Know the Job Market and can hire good professionals or refer them.

You can take decisions more and more importants in a project.

Be a Senior is connected not just the time that you have been working, but is the acquired knowledge in that time and to your professional attitudes.

Now that you reached this level it's time to share your knowledge to become a real **Developer Master**!
