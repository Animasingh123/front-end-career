# Developer career levels

## "Junior"
> The young Padawan

You have the right to make mistakes and the duty to stay thirsty for knowledge!

In that level you don't master programming languages, tools, development enviroment, perhaps neither the operating system that you will work. Easy... Focus on learn, take the advices of those who are longer on the area and look for absorb this knowledge.

You will make mistakes, lots of mistakes if you be proactive, but that's not bad. Unless you mistake the same thing every day. You can make these mistakes because you are trying... You are learning.

If you are not making mistakes is because you are trying litle. And, maybe, you are filling someone with questions, before even start to think. Careful with that attitude.

You need, not only in that level, put aside the shame (or the proud) and **ask**. No one will send you away for wanting to learn.

In this level you still doesn't master the art of delivering things quickly or estimate deadlines for the tasks.

Would be interesting you have a [mentor](https://github.com/training-center/mentoria/) or something like that. Can be a person who inspires you, to follow his steps and try make the same or someone with patience that helps you day to day.

When you earn enough XP, you will become **Middle**!
